 - Python 3: Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently whereas other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactic constructions than other languages.
 - Twypython module: Actively maintained, pure Python wrapper for the Twitter API. Supports both normal and streaming Twitter APIs.
           We can use pip to install the twython module.
