# Software:
 - Python 3: Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently whereas other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactic constructions than other languages.
 - Twypython module: Actively maintained, pure Python wrapper for the Twitter API. Supports both normal and streaming Twitter APIs.
           We can use pip to install the twython module.

# Hardware:
 - Raspberry pi 3: Raspberry Pi is a small computer on which we can install OS (i.e., Linux). In other words, it has no pre-installed OS. We’ll need to install it by yourself if you want it to do something useful.
     As mentioned earlier, Raspberry Pi is a computer and it has the following interfaces:
     - 1.4 GHz 64-bit quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 ,1GB RAM
     - 2.4/5Ghz dual band 802.11ac Wireless LAN, 10/100/1000Mbps Ethernet
     - Bluetooth 4.2
     - 4 USB ports, Full HDMI port, Combined 3.5mm audio jack and composite video port, 40 GPIO pins
     - Micro SD card slot, VideoCore IV 3D graphics core, Camera interface (CSI), Display interface (DSI) 
 - DHT Sensor:
 DHT-11
DHT temperature & humidity sensors are made of two parts, a capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor. There is also a very basic chip inside that does some analog to digital conversion and spits out a digital signal with the temperature and humidity. The digital signal is fairly easy to read using any microcontroller.
     - Ultra low cost
     - 3 to 5V power and I/O
     - 2.5mA max current use during conversion (while requesting data)
     - Good for 20-80% humidity readings with 5% accuracy
     - Good for 0-50°C temperature readings ±2°C accuracy
     - No more than 1 Hz sampling rate (once every second)
     - Body size 15.5mm x 12mm x 5.5mm
     - 4 pins with 0.1" spacing
     - Applications:
       - Measure temperature and humidity
       - Local Weather station
       - Automatic climate control
       - Environment monitoring        
  - Tri-color LED :
A RGB LED is commonly used component in electronics, generally, as it is used for indication purpose. You can use RGB LED in various projects like portable flashlight, LED indicator etc. An RGB LED can also be used for work according to condition like for condition 1st Red will glow, for condition 2nd green will glow and for condition 3rd blue will glow. We can use three different LEDs to perform the same task but this will increase the size of circuit and take more space on PCB .
    - Low Thermal Resistance
    - No UV rays
    - Super High flux Output and High luminance
    - Forward Current for Red, Blue and Green color: 20mA
    - Forward Voltage     
      - Red: 2v (typical)
      - Blue: 3.2(typical)
      - Green: 3.2(typical)
    - Luminous Intensity     
      - Red: 800 mcd
      - Blue: 4000 mcd
      - Green: 900 mcd
    - Wavelength     
      - Red: 625 nm
      - Blue: 520 nm
      - Green: 467.5 nm
    - Operating Temperature: -25 ℃ to 85 ℃
    - Storage Temperature: -30 ℃ to 85 ℃
    - Applications
      - Industrial Application
      - Portable Flashlight/ torchlight
      - Light guides
      - Decorative Lighting
      - LCD backlight
      - Multi-color Light
