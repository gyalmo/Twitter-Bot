# Software:
 - Python 3: Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently whereas other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactic constructions than other languages.
 - Twypython module: Actively maintained, pure Python wrapper for the Twitter API. Supports both normal and streaming Twitter APIs.
           We can use pip to install the twython module.

# Hardware:
 - Raspberry pi 3: Raspberry Pi is a small computer on which we can install OS (i.e., Linux). In other words, it has no pre-installed OS. We’ll need to install it by yourself if you want it to do something useful.
     As mentioned earlier, Raspberry Pi is a computer and it has the following interfaces:
     - 1.4 GHz 64-bit quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 ,1GB RAM
     - 2.4/5Ghz dual band 802.11ac Wireless LAN, 10/100/1000Mbps Ethernet
     - Bluetooth 4.2
     - 4 USB ports, Full HDMI port, Combined 3.5mm audio jack and composite video port, 40 GPIO pins
     - Micro SD card slot, VideoCore IV 3D graphics core, Camera interface (CSI), Display interface (DSI) 
 - DHT Sensor:
 DHT-11
DHT temperature & humidity sensors are made of two parts, a capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor. There is also a very basic chip inside that does some analog to digital conversion and spits out a digital signal with the temperature and humidity. The digital signal is fairly easy to read using any microcontroller.
     - Ultra low cost
     - 3 to 5V power and I/O
     - 2.5mA max current use during conversion (while requesting data)
     - Good for 20-80% humidity readings with 5% accuracy
     - Good for 0-50°C temperature readings ±2°C accuracy
     - No more than 1 Hz sampling rate (once every second)
     - Body size 15.5mm x 12mm x 5.5mm
     - 4 pins with 0.1" spacing
