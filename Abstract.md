# Twitter-Bot
RPi based Twitter bot 

# ABSTRACT
This report presents a new methodology for Twitter bot that bridges the gap between social media . The methodology uses the Twitter APIs .The approach can be extended to any other social media platforms where users typically interact with one another. The approach also offers the opportunity to bring together the advantages of social media research using APIs with the richness of information that can be collected .
It is sometimes desirable to identify when a Twitter account is controlled by a bot ,the following criteria that indicate that an account may be a bot (they were designing an automated system):

•"Periodic and regular timing" of tweets;
•Whether the tweet content contains known spam; and
•The ratio of tweets from mobile versus desktop, as compared to an average human Twitter user.
