# INTRODUCTION

Twitter is a wonderful communication and social media platform. It has everything: breaking news, political opinion, humor, celebrities, entertainment, special interest chat, and, well, anything. Individuals, companies, departments, projects, and more really anyone or anything can have a Twitter account. Some Twitter accounts are not even run manually by a person or a group of people they're automated bots. Twitter bot is a type of bot software that controls a Twitter account via the Twitter APIs.With Twitter APIs and support from developer accounts , benefit us in making a Twitter bot. This will help us hone the skills while working on our own personal growth while creating new opportunities for those who feel left out or excluded from the mass. I have seen Experts leading like wizards and learning from their experience has always been something we look forward to, this will help us achieve that as well. With this project , we will not only be able to hone our coding, speaking and leading skills, but also pave the way for younger Experts and pass on tech idea to them to carry on the love and work for learning.The existence of twitter API has provided unlimited creative access to the information shared and provided on the platform, due to this, different twitter bot has being created for a different purpose, and it has helped make twitter more of a better platform.

Open Python 3 IDLE.
We will Create a new file and paste your API keys from apps.twitter.com into variables.
And , then we will Create another new file and import Twython from the twython module.
